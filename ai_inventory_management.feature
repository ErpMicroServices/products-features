Feature: AI Inventory Management
  As an inventory manager
  I want AI-powered inventory optimization
  So that I can maintain optimal stock levels while minimizing costs and stockouts

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as a user with "INVENTORY_MANAGER" role
    And the AI inventory optimization service is running
    And there is historical sales and inventory data available

  @inventory-ai @demand-forecasting
  Scenario: Predict product demand using AI
    Given a product with 12 months of sales history
    And seasonal patterns are evident in the data
    When I request demand forecasting
    Then the system should predict next month's demand
    And provide confidence intervals for the prediction
    And identify seasonal factors affecting demand
    And suggest optimal stock levels

  @inventory-ai @reorder-optimization
  Scenario: Optimize reorder points and quantities
    Given a product with varying lead times and demand
    And current reorder point is set manually
    When I run AI inventory optimization
    Then the system should suggest an improved reorder point
    And calculate optimal reorder quantity
    And factor in lead time variability
    And minimize total inventory costs

  @inventory-ai @stockout-prevention
  Scenario: Predict and prevent stockouts
    Given products with different demand patterns
    And some products approaching low stock levels
    When I run stockout risk analysis
    Then high-risk products should be identified
    And risk scores should be provided
    And recommended actions should be suggested
    And alerts should be generated for urgent cases

  @inventory-ai @overstock-detection
  Scenario: Identify and manage overstock situations
    Given products with slow-moving inventory
    When I run overstock analysis
    Then products with excess inventory should be identified
    And overstock risk scores should be calculated
    And recommendations for clearance or promotion should be provided
    And carrying cost implications should be highlighted

  @inventory-ai @dynamic-safety-stock
  Scenario: Calculate dynamic safety stock levels
    Given products with variable demand and supply patterns
    When I request safety stock optimization
    Then the system should calculate dynamic safety stock levels
    And adjust for demand variability
    And consider supply chain reliability
    And balance service level targets with carrying costs

  @inventory-ai @seasonal-adjustments
  Scenario: Adjust inventory for seasonal patterns
    Given products with strong seasonal demand patterns
    And we are approaching peak season
    When I run seasonal inventory planning
    Then the system should recommend seasonal stock increases
    And provide timing recommendations for stock buildup
    And suggest post-season inventory reduction strategies
    And factor in storage capacity constraints

  @inventory-ai @multi-location-optimization
  Scenario: Optimize inventory across multiple locations
    Given products stocked in multiple warehouses
    And different demand patterns by location
    When I run multi-location inventory optimization
    Then the system should optimize stock allocation across locations
    And suggest inventory transfers between locations
    And minimize total system inventory while maintaining service levels
    And consider transportation costs in recommendations

  @inventory-ai @supplier-performance
  Scenario: Factor supplier performance into inventory decisions
    Given suppliers with different reliability records
    And varying lead times and quality metrics
    When I run inventory optimization
    Then the system should adjust inventory levels based on supplier reliability
    And recommend safety stock adjustments for unreliable suppliers
    And suggest supplier diversification where appropriate
    And factor in supplier relationship strength

  @inventory-ai @iot-integration
  Scenario: Integrate with IoT sensors for real-time inventory tracking
    Given IoT sensors monitoring inventory levels
    And real-time stock level data is available
    When inventory levels are updated automatically
    Then the AI system should adjust predictions based on real-time data
    And trigger reorder recommendations when thresholds are reached
    And detect discrepancies between expected and actual inventory
    And alert for potential theft or loss

  @inventory-ai @financial-impact
  Scenario: Calculate financial impact of inventory decisions
    Given current inventory levels and proposed optimizations
    When I request financial impact analysis
    Then the system should calculate potential cost savings
    And estimate cash flow improvements from optimization
    And quantify service level improvements
    And provide ROI projections for implementing recommendations

  @inventory-ai @new-product-forecasting
  Scenario: Handle new products without historical data
    Given a new product with no sales history
    And similar products with historical data exist
    When I request demand forecasting for the new product
    Then the system should use comparable product data
    And apply market research insights if available
    And provide wider confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty
    And recommend conservative initial stocking levels

  @inventory-ai @performance-monitoring
  Scenario: Monitor and improve AI model performance
    Given AI inventory recommendations have been implemented
    And sufficient time has passed to measure results
    When I review AI model performance
    Then the system should compare actual vs predicted demand
    And calculate forecast accuracy metrics
    And identify areas where the model underperformed
    And automatically retrain models based on new data
    And provide insights for continuous improvement
